abstract = {Interest in control of multiple autonomous vehicles continues to grow for applications such as weather monitoring, geographical mapping fauna surveys, and extra-terrestrial exploration. The task of persistent surveillance is of particular significance in that the target area needs to be continuously surveyed, minimizing the time between visitations to the same region. This distinction from one-time coverage does not allow a straightforward application of most exploration techniques to the problem, though ideas from these methods can still be used. The aerial vehicle dynamic and endurance constraints add additional complexity to the autonomous control problem, whereas stochastic environments and vehicle failures introduce uncertainty. In this work, we investigate techniques for high-level control, that are scalable, reliable, efficient, and robust to problem dynamics. Next, we suggest a modification to the control policy to account for aircraft dynamic constraints. We also devise a health monitoring policy and a control policy modification to improve performance under endurance constraints. The Vehicle Swarm Technology Laboratory-a hardware testbed developed at Boeing Research and Technology, Seattle, WA, for evaluating a swarm of unmanned air vehicles-is then described, and these control policies are tested in a realistic scenario.},

abstract={This paper proposes a novel algorithm for performing multi-robot coverage on networks with dendritic topology where the communication topology is location dependent and where the motion of each robot is constrained by the presence of the other robots in the network. The algorithm provides complete network coverage by the minimum number of robots, maintenance of communication constraints and robot collision avoidance. The minimum number of robots required for coverage is a by-product of the proposed algorithm. The efficiency of the algorithm is demonstrated through simulation studies.},

abstract={This paper addresses the persistent coverage problem, in which a group of autonomous robots must visit periodically a finite set of interest points and spend some time covering them, which we call coverage time. An optimization problem to calculate the optimal coverage times is formulated, and sufficient conditions for the existence of solution are given. In particular, a linear cost function is considered to solve the problem as a linear program. An iterative algorithm, which runs on the solution, is proposed to reduce the lengths of the predefined paths traveled by the robots in a finite number of iterations while maintaining optimal coverage times. Moreover, path planning is included in the optimization problem, computing specific weights in the cost function, and thus reducing the traveled distances and the total time spent covering. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the approach.},

abstract = {In this paper we address the problem of persistent coverage of a given convex polygonal region in the plane. We present an algorithmic solution for this problem that takes into account the limitations in the communication and sensing ranges of the agents. We show that our algorithm provides a persistent coverage period that is bounded away by a constant factor from a minimal tour among the centers of an optimal static cover, which is comprised of circles having the same radius as the sensing radius of the agents. A simulation is provided that illustrates the algorithm.},

abstract = {This paper studies the problem of dynamically covering a given region in the plane using a set of mobile sensor agents. A novel problem formulation is proposed that addresses a number of important multiagent missions. The coverage goal, which is to cover a given search domain using multiple mobile sensors such that each point is surveyed until a certain preset level is achieved, is formulated in a mathematically precise problem statement. A control law is developed that guarantees to meet the coverage goal. This control law is modified to guarantee that a partially connected fleet also attains the coverage goal. Finally, a collision avoidance component is added to the controller to guarantee that the agents do not collide. The new controller is shown to safely achieve coverage. Several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the main results. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

This research attempts to create an adaptive decentralized procedure for autonomous agents to create formations using CVTs.
